# 100daysofcode
This repo houses all my little projects for my 100daysofcode as a developer (Codes will not be of a single stacks)

DAY 1:
I implemented a UI design with flutter using dart. The design is a about page for a tourist site. I then added interactivity to the favorite icon using the setState() method. if you click on the star it toggles the interior color and either increases or decreases the favorite count by 1

DAY 2:
I played around with FloatingActionButton class in Flutter to create a ninja profile UI... lol

DAY 3:
I implemented the graph algorithm, Breadth First Search in C++

DAY 4:
I wrote a C++ code to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph using the Breadth First Search algorithm.

DAY 5:
I went into problem solving. Had a go at a problem from the International Olympiad in Informatics 2012 in Italy (Ideal City). I applied Breadth First Search algorithm to solve the problem, partially though... lol [file names: City]
